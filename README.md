Properly supports password/question prompts and messages.
Once the animation finishes, it loops the logo with the blinking dot.
Feel free to open an issue for any type of feedback!

To install it, download the source and either run the install.sh,
or copy the contents of images (not the folder), the ctos.plymouth and the ctos.script to /usr/share/plymouth/themes/ctos/ and install it manually.
